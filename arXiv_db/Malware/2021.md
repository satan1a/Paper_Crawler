- `2101.00521v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00521v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00521v1)

> Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are used by adversaries to establish Command and Control (C\&C) server communications during cyber attacks. Blacklists of known/identified C\&C domains are often used as one of the defense mechanisms. However, since blacklists are static and generated by signature-based approaches, they can neither keep up nor detect never-seen-before malicious domain names. Due to this shortcoming of blacklist domain checking, machine learning algorithms have been used to address the problem to some extent. However, when training is performed with limited datasets, the algorithms are likely to fail in detecting new DGA variants. To mitigate this weakness, we successfully applied a DGA-based malicious domain classifier using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method with a novel feature engineering technique. Our model's performance shows a higher level of accuracy compared to a previously reported model from prior research. Additionally, we propose a new method using adversarial machine learning to generate never-before-seen malware-related domain families that can be used to illustrate the shortcomings of machine learning algorithms in this regard. Next, we augment the training dataset with new samples such that it makes training of the machine learning models more effective in detecting never-before-seen malicious domain name variants. Finally, to protect blacklists of malicious domain names from disclosure and tampering, we devise secure data containers that store blacklists and guarantee their protection against adversarial access and modifications.

<summary>2021-01-04 14:54:20 - Echelon: Two-Tier Malware Detection for Raw Executables to Reduce False Alarms</summary>

- *Anandharaju Durai Raju, Ke Wang*

- `2101.01015v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01015v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01015v1)

> Existing malware detection approaches suffer from a simplistic trade-off between false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) due to a single tier classification approach, where the two measures adversely affect one another. The practical implication for malware detection is that FPR must be kept at an acceptably low level while TPR remains high. To this end, we propose a two-tiered learning, called ``Echelon", from raw byte data with no need for hand-crafted features. The first tier locks FPR at a specified target level, whereas the second tier improves TPR while maintaining the locked FPR. The core of Echelon lies at extracting activation information of the hidden layers of first tier model for constructing a stronger second tier model. Echelon is a framework in that it allows any existing CNN based model to be adapted in both tiers. We present experimental results of evaluating Echelon by adapting the state-of-the-art malware detection model ``Malconv" in the first and second tiers.

- *Giorgio Severi, Jim Meyer, Scott Coull, Alina Oprea*

- `2003.01031v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01031v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01031v3)

> Training pipelines for machine learning (ML) based malware classification often rely on crowdsourced threat feeds, exposing a natural attack injection point. In this paper, we study the susceptibility of feature-based ML malware classifiers to backdoor poisoning attacks, specifically focusing on challenging "clean label" attacks where attackers do not control the sample labeling process. We propose the use of techniques from explainable machine learning to guide the selection of relevant features and values to create effective backdoor triggers in a model-agnostic fashion. Using multiple reference datasets for malware classification, including Windows PE files, PDFs, and Android applications, we demonstrate effective attacks against a diverse set of machine learning models and evaluate the effect of various constraints imposed on the attacker. To demonstrate the feasibility of our backdoor attacks in practice, we create a watermarking utility for Windows PE files that preserves the binary's functionality, and we leverage similar behavior-preserving alteration methodologies for Android and PDF files. Finally, we experiment with potential defensive strategies and show the difficulties of completely defending against these attacks, especially when the attacks blend in with the legitimate sample distribution.

<summary>2021-01-13 05:46:44 - Towards Interpretable Ensemble Learning for Image-based Malware Detection</summary>

- *Yuzhou Lin, Xiaolin Chang*

- `2101.04889v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04889v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04889v1)

> Deep learning (DL) models for image-based malware detection have exhibited their capability in producing high prediction accuracy. But model interpretability is posing challenges to their widespread application in security and safety-critical application domains. This paper aims for designing an Interpretable Ensemble learning approach for image-based Malware Detection (IEMD). We first propose a Selective Deep Ensemble Learning-based (SDEL) detector and then design an Ensemble Deep Taylor Decomposition (EDTD) approach, which can give the pixel-level explanation to SDEL detector outputs. Furthermore, we develop formulas for calculating fidelity, robustness and expressiveness on pixel-level heatmaps in order to assess the quality of EDTD explanation. With EDTD explanation, we develop a novel Interpretable Dropout approach (IDrop), which establishes IEMD by training SDEL detector. Experiment results exhibit the better explanation of our EDTD than the previous explanation methods for image-based malware detection. Besides, experiment results indicate that IEMD achieves a higher detection accuracy up to 99.87% while exhibiting interpretability with high quality of prediction results. Moreover, experiment results indicate that IEMD interpretability increases with the increasing detection accuracy during the construction of IEMD. This consistency suggests that IDrop can mitigate the tradeoff between model interpretability and detection accuracy.

- *Cengiz Acarturk, Melih Sirlanci, Pinar Gurkan Balikcioglu, Deniz Demirci, Nazenin Sahin, Ozge Acar Kucuk*

- `2101.05646v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05646v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05646v1)

> Malicious software threats and their detection have been gaining importance as a subdomain of information security due to the expansion of ICT applications in daily settings. A major challenge in designing and developing anti-malware systems is the coverage of the detection, particularly the development of dynamic analysis methods that can detect polymorphic and metamorphic malware efficiently. In the present study, we propose a methodological framework for detecting malicious code by analyzing run trace outputs by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We developed models of run traces of malicious and benign Portable Executable (PE) files. We created our dataset from run trace outputs obtained from dynamic analysis of PE files. The obtained dataset was in the instruction format as a sequence and was called Instruction as a Sequence Model (ISM). By splitting the first dataset into basic blocks, we obtained the second one called Basic Block as a Sequence Model (BSM). The experiments showed that the ISM achieved an accuracy of 87.51% and a false positive rate of 18.34%, while BSM achieved an accuracy of 99.26% and a false positive rate of 2.62%.

<summary>2021-01-15 09:41:05 - RAICC: Revealing Atypical Inter-Component Communication in Android Apps</summary>

- *Jordan Samhi, Alexandre Bartel, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé, Jacques Klein*

- `2012.09916v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09916v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09916v2)

> Inter-Component Communication (ICC) is a key mechanism in Android. It enables developers to compose rich functionalities and explore reuse within and across apps. Unfortunately, as reported by a large body of literature, ICC is rather "complex and largely unconstrained", leaving room to a lack of precision in apps modeling. To address the challenge of tracking ICCs within apps, state of the art static approaches such as Epicc, IccTA and Amandroid have focused on the documented framework ICC methods (e.g., startActivity) to build their approaches. In this work we show that ICC models inferred in these state of the art tools may actually be incomplete: the framework provides other atypical ways of performing ICCs. To address this limitation in the state of the art, we propose RAICC a static approach for modeling new ICC links and thus boosting previous analysis tasks such as ICC vulnerability detection, privacy leaks detection, malware detection, etc. We have evaluated RAICC on 20 benchmark apps, demonstrating that it improves the precision and recall of uncovered leaks in state of the art tools. We have also performed a large empirical investigation showing that Atypical ICC methods are largely used in Android apps, although not necessarily for data transfer. We also show that RAICC increases the number of ICC links found by 61.6% on a dataset of real-world malicious apps, and that RAICC enables the detection of new ICC vulnerabilities.

- *Jordan Samhi, Kevin Allix, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé, Jacques Klein*

- `2006.11002v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11002v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11002v2)

> Due to the convenience of access-on-demand to information and business solutions, mobile apps have become an important asset in the digital world. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, app developers have joined the response effort in various ways by releasing apps that target different user bases (e.g., all citizens or journalists), offer different services (e.g., location tracking or diagnostic-aid), provide generic or specialized information, etc. While many apps have raised some concerns by spreading misinformation or even malware, the literature does not yet provide a clear landscape of the different apps that were developed. In this study, we focus on the Android ecosystem and investigate Covid-related Android apps. In a best-effort scenario, we attempt to systematically identify all relevant apps and study their characteristics with the objective to provide a First taxonomy of Covid-related apps, broadening the relevance beyond the implementation of contact tracing. Overall, our study yields a number of empirical insights that contribute to enlarge the knowledge on Covid-related apps: (1) Developer communities contributed rapidly to the Covid-19, with dedicated apps released as early as January 2020; (2) Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in the majority of cases, Covid-related apps are released by entities with past experience on the market, mostly official government entities or public health organizations.

<summary>2021-01-15 15:29:02 - A Framework for Enhancing Deep Neural Networks Against Adversarial Malware</summary>

- *Deqiang Li, Qianmu Li, Yanfang Ye, Shouhuai Xu*

- `2004.07919v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07919v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07919v3)

> Machine learning-based malware detection is known to be vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks. The state-of-the-art is that there are no effective defenses against these attacks. As a response to the adversarial malware classification challenge organized by the MIT Lincoln Lab and associated with the AAAI-19 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS'2019), we propose six guiding principles to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks. Some of these principles have been scattered in the literature, but the others are introduced in this paper for the first time. Under the guidance of these six principles, we propose a defense framework to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. By conducting experiments with the Drebin Android malware dataset, we show that the framework can achieve a 98.49\% accuracy (on average) against grey-box attacks, where the attacker knows some information about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack, and an 89.14% accuracy (on average) against the more capable white-box attacks, where the attacker knows everything about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack. The framework wins the AICS'2019 challenge by achieving a 76.02% accuracy, where neither the attacker (i.e., the challenge organizer) knows the framework or defense nor we (the defender) know the attacks. This gap highlights the importance of knowing about the attack.

<summary>2021-01-15 17:34:40 - Towards interpreting ML-based automated malware detection models: a survey</summary>

- *Yuzhou Lin, Xiaolin Chang*

- `2101.06232v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06232v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06232v1)

> Malware is being increasingly threatening and malware detectors based on traditional signature-based analysis are no longer suitable for current malware detection. Recently, the models based on machine learning (ML) are developed for predicting unknown malware variants and saving human strength. However, most of the existing ML models are black-box, which made their pre-diction results undependable, and therefore need further interpretation in order to be effectively deployed in the wild. This paper aims to examine and categorize the existing researches on ML-based malware detector interpretability. We first give a detailed comparison over the previous work on common ML model inter-pretability in groups after introducing the principles, attributes, evaluation indi-cators and taxonomy of common ML interpretability. Then we investigate the interpretation methods towards malware detection, by addressing the importance of interpreting malware detectors, challenges faced by this field, solutions for migitating these challenges, and a new taxonomy for classifying all the state-of-the-art malware detection interpretability work in recent years. The highlight of our survey is providing a new taxonomy towards malware detection interpreta-tion methods based on the common taxonomy summarized by previous re-searches in the common field. In addition, we are the first to evaluate the state-of-the-art approaches by interpretation method attributes to generate the final score so as to give insight to quantifying the interpretability. By concluding the results of the recent researches, we hope our work can provide suggestions for researchers who are interested in the interpretability on ML-based malware de-tection models.

> Recent technological advancements have proliferated the use of small embedded devices for collecting, processing, and transferring the security-critical information. The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled remote access and control of these network-connected devices. Consequently, an attacker can exploit security vulnerabilities and compromise these devices. In this context, the secure boot becomes a useful security mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the software state of the devices. However, the current secure boot schemes focus on detecting the presence of potential malware on the device but not on disinfecting and restoring the soft-ware to a benign state. This manuscript presents CARE- the first secure boot framework that provides detection, resilience, and onboard recovery mechanism for the com-promised devices. The framework uses a prototype hybrid CARE: Code Authentication and Resilience Engine to verify the software state and restore it to a benign state. It uses Physical Memory Protection (PMP) and other security enchaining techniques of RISC-V processor to pro-vide resilience from modern attacks. The state-of-the-art comparison and performance analysis results indicate that the proposed secure boot framework provides a promising resilience and recovery mechanism with very little 8 % performance and resource overhead

> Attributing a piece of malware to its creator typically requires threat intelligence. Binary attribution increases the level of difficulty as it mostly relies upon the ability to disassemble binaries to identify authorship style. Our survey explores malicious author style and the adversarial techniques used by them to remain anonymous. We examine the adversarial impact on the state-of-the-art methods. We identify key findings and explore the open research challenges. To mitigate the lack of ground truth datasets in this domain, we publish alongside this survey the largest and most diverse meta-information dataset of 15,660 malware labeled to 164 threat actor groups.

> Most of today's security solutions, such as security information and event management (SIEM) and signature based IDS, require the operator to evaluate potential attack vectors and update detection signatures and rules in a timely manner. However, today's sophisticated and tailored advanced persistent threats (APT), malware, ransomware and rootkits, can be so complex and diverse, and often use zero day exploits, that a pure signature-based blacklisting approach would not be sufficient to detect them. Therefore, we could observe a major paradigm shift towards anomaly-based detection mechanisms, which try to establish a system behavior baseline -- either based on netflow data or system logging data -- and report any deviations from this baseline. While these approaches look promising, they usually suffer from scalability issues. As the amount of log data generated during IT operations is exponentially growing, high-performance analysis methods are required that can handle this huge amount of data in real-time. In this paper, we demonstrate how high-performance bioinformatics tools can be applied to tackle this issue. We investigate their application to log data for outlier detection to timely reveal anomalous system behavior that points to cyber attacks. Finally, we assess the detection capability and run-time performance of the proposed approach.

> There is a growing body of malware samples that evade automated analysis and detection tools. Malware may measure fingerprints ("artifacts") of the underlying analysis tool or environment and change their behavior when artifacts are detected. While analysis tools can mitigate artifacts to reduce exposure, such concealment is expensive. However, not every sample checks for every type of artifact-analysis efficiency can be improved by mitigating only those artifacts most likely to be used by a sample. Using that insight, we propose MIMOSA, a system that identifies a small set of "covering" tool configurations that collectively defeat most malware samples with increased efficiency. MIMOSA identifies a set of tool configurations that maximize analysis throughput and detection accuracy while minimizing manual effort, enabling scalable automation to analyze stealthy malware. We evaluate our approach against a benchmark of 1535 labeled stealthy malware samples. Our approach increases analysis throughput over state of the art on over 95% of these samples. We also investigate cost-benefit tradeoffs between the fraction of successfully-analyzed samples and computing resources required. MIMOSA provides a practical, tunable method for efficiently deploying analysis resources.

> In this paper, we present MORTON, a method that identifies compromised devices in enterprise networks based on the existence of routine DNS communication between devices and disreputable host names. With its compact representation of the input data and use of efficient signal processing and a neural network for classification, MORTON is designed to be accurate, robust, and scalable. We evaluate MORTON using a large dataset of corporate DNS logs and compare it with two recently proposed beaconing detection methods aimed at detecting malware communication. The results demonstrate that while MORTON's accuracy in a synthetic experiment is comparable to that of the other methods, it outperforms those methods in terms of its ability to detect sophisticated bot communication techniques, such as multistage channels, as well as in its robustness and efficiency. In a real-world evaluation, which includes previously unreported threats, MORTON and the two compared methods were deployed to monitor the (unlabeled) DNS traffic of two global enterprises for a week-long period; this evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MORTON in real-world scenarios and showcases its superiority in terms of true and false positive rates.

> Nowadays, malware campaigns have reached a high level of sophistication, thanks to the use of cryptography and covert communication channels over traditional protocols and services. In this regard, a typical approach to evade botnet identification and takedown mechanisms is the use of domain fluxing through the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). These algorithms produce an overwhelming amount of domain names that the infected device tries to communicate with to find the Command and Control server, yet only a small fragment of them is actually registered. Due to the high number of domain names, the blacklisting approach is rendered useless. Therefore, the botmaster may pivot the control dynamically and hinder botnet detection mechanisms. To counter this problem, many security mechanisms result in solutions that try to identify domains from a DGA based on the randomness of their name.   In this work, we explore hard to detect families of DGAs, as they are constructed to bypass these mechanisms. More precisely, they are based on the use of dictionaries so the domains seem to be user-generated. Therefore, the corresponding generated domains pass many filters that look for, e.g. high entropy strings. To address this challenge, we propose an accurate and efficient probabilistic approach to detect them. We test and validate the proposed solution through extensive experiments with a sound dataset containing all the wordlist-based DGA families that exhibit this behaviour and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods, practically showing the efficacy and prevalence of our proposal.

> We propose a novel method to detect and visualize malware through image classification. The executable binaries are represented as grayscale images obtained from the count of N-grams (N=2) of bytes in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and a neural network is trained for malware detection. A shallow neural network is trained for classification, and its accuracy is compared with deep-network architectures such as ResNet that are trained using transfer learning. Neither dis-assembly nor behavioral analysis of malware is required for these methods. Motivated by the visual similarity of these images for different malware families, we compare our deep neural network models with standard image features like GIST descriptors to evaluate the performance. A joint feature measure is proposed to combine different features using error analysis to get an accurate ensemble model for improved classification performance. A new dataset called MaleX which contains around 1 million malware and benign Windows executable samples is created for large-scale malware detection and classification experiments. Experimental results are quite promising with 96% binary classification accuracy on MaleX. The proposed model is also able to generalize well on larger unseen malware samples and the results compare favorably with state-of-the-art static analysis-based malware detection algorithms.

> The current state-of-the-art Android malware detection systems are based on machine learning and deep learning models. Despite having superior performance, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Therefore in this paper, we developed eight Android malware detection models based on machine learning and deep neural network and investigated their robustness against adversarial attacks. For this purpose, we created new variants of malware using Reinforcement Learning, which will be misclassified as benign by the existing Android malware detection models. We propose two novel attack strategies, namely single policy attack and multiple policy attack using reinforcement learning for white-box and grey-box scenario respectively. Putting ourselves in the adversary's shoes, we designed adversarial attacks on the detection models with the goal of maximizing fooling rate, while making minimum modifications to the Android application and ensuring that the app's functionality and behavior do not change. We achieved an average fooling rate of 44.21% and 53.20% across all the eight detection models with a maximum of five modifications using a single policy attack and multiple policy attack, respectively. The highest fooling rate of 86.09% with five changes was attained against the decision tree-based model using the multiple policy approach. Finally, we propose an adversarial defense strategy that reduces the average fooling rate by threefold to 15.22% against a single policy attack, thereby increasing the robustness of the detection models i.e. the proposed model can effectively detect variants (metamorphic) of malware. The experimental analysis shows that our proposed Android malware detection system using reinforcement learning is more robust against adversarial attacks.

- `2010.03856v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03856v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03856v4)

> Machine learning for malware classification shows encouraging results, but real deployments suffer from performance degradation as malware authors adapt their techniques to evade detection. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, occurs as new malware examples evolve and become less and less like the original training examples. One promising method to cope with concept drift is classification with rejection in which examples that are likely to be misclassified are instead quarantined until they can be expertly analyzed. We propose TRANSCENDENT, a rejection framework built on Transcend, a recently proposed strategy based on conformal prediction theory. In particular, we provide a formal treatment of Transcend, enabling us to refine conformal evaluation theory -- its underlying statistical engine -- and gain a better understanding of the theoretical reasons for its effectiveness. In the process, we develop two additional conformal evaluators that match or surpass the performance of the original while significantly decreasing the computational overhead. We evaluate TRANSCENDENT on a malware dataset spanning 5 years that removes sources of experimental bias present in the original evaluation. To further assist practitioners, we determine the optimal operational settings for a TRANSCENDENT deployment and show how it can be applied to many popular learning algorithms. These insights support both old and new empirical findings, making Transcend a sound and practical solution for the first time. To this end, we release TRANSCENDENT as open source, to aid the adoption of rejection strategies by the security community.

> Android is currently the most extensively used smartphone platform in the world. Due to its popularity and open source nature, Android malware has been rapidly growing in recent years, and bringing great risks to users' privacy. The malware applications in a malware family may have common features and similar behaviors, which are beneficial for malware detection and inspection. Thus, classifying Android malware into their corresponding families is an important task in malware analysis. At present, the main problem of existing research works on Android malware family classification lies in that the extracted features are inadequate to represent the common behavior characteristics of the malware in malicious families, and leveraging a single classifier or a static ensemble classifier is restricted to further improve the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we propose FamDroid, a learning-based Android malware family classification scheme using static analysis technology. In FamDroid, the explicit features including permissions, hardware components, app components, intent filters are extracted from the apk files of a malware application. Besides, a hidden feature generated from the extracted APIs is used to represents the API call relationship in the application. Then, we design an adaptive weighted ensemble classifier, which considers the adaptability of the sample to each base classifier, to carry out accurate malware family classification. We conducted experiments on the Drebin dataset which contains 5560 Android malicious applications. The superiority of FamDroid is demonstrated through comparing it with 5 traditional machine learning models and 4 state-of-the-art reference schemes. FamDroid can correctly classify 98.92% of malware samples into their families and achieve 99.12% F1-Score.

- `2101.12434v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12434v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12434v1)

> Ransomware is a growing threat that typically operates by either encrypting a victim's files or locking a victim's computer until the victim pays a ransom. However, it is still challenging to detect such malware timely with existing traditional malware detection techniques. In this paper, we present a novel ransomware detection system, called "Peeler" (Profiling kErnEl -Level Events to detect Ransomware). Peeler deviates from signatures for individual ransomware samples and relies on common and generic characteristics of ransomware depicted at the kernel-level. Analyzing diverse ransomware families, we observed ransomware's inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations performed before the attack, file I/O request patterns, process spawning, and correlations among kernel-level events. Based on those characteristics, we develop Peeler that continuously monitors a target system's kernel events and detects ransomware attacks on the system. Our experimental results show that Peeler achieves more than 99\% detection rate with 0.58\% false-positive rate against 43 distinct ransomware families, containing samples from both crypto and screen-locker types of ransomware. For crypto ransomware, Peeler detects them promptly after only one file is lost (within 115 milliseconds on average). Peeler utilizes around 4.9\% of CPU time with only 9.8 MB memory under the normal workload condition. Our analysis demonstrates that Peeler can efficiently detect diverse malware families by monitoring their kernel-level events.

> Computer vision is playing an increasingly important role in automated malware detection with to the rise of the image-based binary representation. These binary images are fast to generate, require no feature engineering, and are resilient to popular obfuscation methods. Significant research has been conducted in this area, however, it has been restricted to small-scale or private datasets that only a few industry labs and research teams have access to. This lack of availability hinders examination of existing work, development of new research, and dissemination of ideas. We introduce MalNet, the largest publicly available cybersecurity image database, offering 133x more images and 27x more classes than the only other public binary-image database. MalNet contains over 1.2 million images across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families. We provide extensive analysis of MalNet, discussing its properties and provenance. The scale and diversity of MalNet unlocks new and exciting cybersecurity opportunities to the computer vision community--enabling discoveries and research directions that were previously not possible. The database is publicly available at www.mal-net.org.

- `2102.00898v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00898v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00898v1)

> In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to normalize metamorphic and obfuscated malware down at the opcode level and hence create an advanced metamorphic malware de-obfuscation and defense system. We name this system DRLDO, for Deep Reinforcement Learning based De-Obfuscator. With the inclusion of the DRLDO as a sub-component, an existing Intrusion Detection System could be augmented with defensive capabilities against 'zero-day' attacks from obfuscated and metamorphic variants of existing malware. This gains importance, not only because there exists no system to date that uses advanced DRL to intelligently and automatically normalize obfuscation down even to the opcode level, but also because the DRLDO system does not mandate any changes to the existing IDS. The DRLDO system does not even mandate the IDS' classifier to be retrained with any new dataset containing obfuscated samples. Hence DRLDO could be easily retrofitted into any existing IDS deployment. We designed, developed, and conducted experiments on the system to evaluate the same against multiple-simultaneous attacks from obfuscations generated from malware samples from a standardized dataset that contains multiple generations of malware. Experimental results prove that DRLDO was able to successfully make the otherwise un-detectable obfuscated variants of the malware detectable by an existing pre-trained malware classifier. The detection probability was raised well above the cut-off mark to 0.6 for the classifier to detect the obfuscated malware unambiguously. Further, the de-obfuscated variants generated by DRLDO achieved a very high correlation (of 0.99) with the base malware. This observation validates that the DRLDO system is actually learning to de-obfuscate and not exploiting a trivial trick.

- *Zainab Abaid, Dilip Sarkar, Mohamed Ali Kaafar, Sanjay Jha*

- `2102.01944v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01944v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01944v1)

> Many techniques have been proposed for quickly detecting and containing malware-generated network attacks such as large-scale denial of service attacks; unfortunately, much damage is already done within the first few minutes of an attack, before it is identified and contained. There is a need for an early warning system that can predict attacks before they actually manifest, so that upcoming attacks can be prevented altogether by blocking the hosts that are likely to engage in attacks. However, blocking responses may disrupt legitimate processes on blocked hosts; in order to minimise user inconvenience, it is important to also foretell the time when the predicted attacks will occur, so that only the most urgent threats result in auto-blocking responses, while less urgent ones are first manually investigated. To this end, we identify a typical infection sequence followed by modern malware; modelling this sequence as a Markov chain and training it on real malicious traffic, we are able to identify behaviour most likely to lead to attacks and predict 98\% of real-world spamming and port-scanning attacks before they occur. Moreover, using a Semi-Markov chain model, we are able to foretell the time of upcoming attacks, a novel capability that allows accurately predicting the times of 97% of real-world malware attacks. Our work represents an important and timely step towards enabling flexible threat response models that minimise disruption to legitimate users.

- *N. Benjamin Erichson, Dane Taylor, Qixuan Wu, Michael W. Mahoney*

- `2008.00123v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00123v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00123v2)

> The ubiquity of deep neural networks (DNNs), cloud-based training, and transfer learning is giving rise to a new cybersecurity frontier in which unsecure DNNs have `structural malware' (i.e., compromised weights and activation pathways). In particular, DNNs can be designed to have backdoors that allow an adversary to easily and reliably fool an image classifier by adding a pattern of pixels called a trigger. It is generally difficult to detect backdoors, and existing detection methods are computationally expensive and require extensive resources (e.g., access to the training data). Here, we propose a rapid feature-generation technique that quantifies the robustness of a DNN, `fingerprints' its nonlinearity, and allows us to detect backdoors (if present). Our approach involves studying how a DNN responds to noise-infused images with varying noise intensity, which we summarize with titration curves. We find that DNNs with backdoors are more sensitive to input noise and respond in a characteristic way that reveals the backdoor and where it leads (its `target'). Our empirical results demonstrate that we can accurately detect backdoors with high confidence orders-of-magnitude faster than existing approaches (seconds versus hours).

> In recent years, malware becomes more threatening. Concerning the increasing malware variants, there comes Machine Learning (ML)-based and Deep Learning (DL)-based approaches for heuristic detection. Nevertheless, the prediction accuracy of both needs to be improved. In response to the above issues in the PE malware domain, we propose the DL-based approaches for detection and use static-based features fed up into models. The contributions are as follows: we recapitulate existing malware detection methods. That is, we propose a vec-torized representation model of the malware instruction layer and semantic layer based on Glove. We implement a neural network model called MCC_RCNN (Malware Detection and Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network), comprising of the combination with CNN and RNN. Moreover, we provide a description of feature fusion in static behavior levels. With the numerical results generated from several comparative experiments towards evaluating the Glove-based vectoriza-tion, MCC_RCNN-based classification methodology and feature fusion stages, our proposed classification methods can obtain a higher prediction accuracy than the other baseline methods.

> In this paper we investigate the problem of automatically naming pieces of assembly code. Where by naming we mean assigning to an assembly function a string of words that would likely be assigned by a human reverse engineer. We formally and precisely define the framework in which our investigation takes place. That is we define the problem, we provide reasonable justifications for the choices that we made for the design of training and the tests. We performed an analysis on a large real-world corpora constituted by nearly 9 millions of functions taken from more than 22k softwares. In such framework we test baselines coming from the field of Natural Language Processing (e.g., Seq2Seq networks and Transformer). Interestingly, our evaluation shows promising results beating the state-of-the-art and reaching good performance. We investigate the applicability of tine-tuning (i.e., taking a model already trained on a large generic corpora and retraining it for a specific task). Such technique is popular and well-known in the NLP field. Our results confirm that fine-tuning is effective even when neural networks are applied to binaries. We show that a model, pre-trained on the aforementioned corpora, when fine-tuned has higher performances on specific domains (such as predicting names in system utilites, malware, etc).

> Malware analysis has been extensively investigated as the number and types of malware has increased dramatically. However, most previous studies use end-to-end systems to detect whether a sample is malicious, or to identify its malware family. In this paper, we propose a neural network framework composed of an embedder, an encoder, and a filter to learn malware representations from characteristic execution sequences for malware family classification. The embedder uses BERT and Sent2Vec, state-of-the-art embedding modules, to capture relations within a single API call and among consecutive API calls in an execution trace. The encoder comprises gated recurrent units (GRU) to preserve the ordinal position of API calls and a self-attention mechanism for comparing intra-relations among different positions of API calls. The filter identifies representative API calls to build the malware representation. We conduct broad experiments to determine the influence of individual framework components. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baselines, and also demonstrates that considering Sent2Vec to learn complete API call embeddings and GRU to explicitly preserve ordinal information yields more information and thus significant improvements. Also, the proposed approach effectively classifies new malicious execution traces on the basis of similarities with previously collected families.

> Numerous recent studies have demonstrated how Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers can be fooled by adversarial examples, in which an attacker adds perturbations to an original sample, causing the classifier to misclassify the sample. Adversarial attacks that render DNNs vulnerable in real life represent a serious threat in autonomous vehicles, malware filters, or biometric authentication systems. In this paper, we apply Fast Gradient Sign Method to introduce perturbations to a facial image dataset and then test the output on a different classifier that we trained ourselves, to analyze transferability of this method. Next, we craft a variety of different black-box attack algorithms on a facial image dataset assuming minimal adversarial knowledge, to further assess the robustness of DNNs in facial recognition. While experimenting with different image distortion techniques, we focus on modifying single optimal pixels by a large amount, or modifying all pixels by a smaller amount, or combining these two attack approaches. While our single-pixel attacks achieved about a 15% average decrease in classifier confidence level for the actual class, the all-pixel attacks were more successful and achieved up to an 84% average decrease in confidence, along with an 81.6% misclassification rate, in the case of the attack that we tested with the highest levels of perturbation. Even with these high levels of perturbation, the face images remained identifiable to a human. Understanding how these noised and perturbed images baffle the classification algorithms can yield valuable advances in the training of DNNs against defense-aware adversarial attacks, as well as adaptive noise reduction techniques. We hope our research may help to advance the study of adversarial attacks on DNNs and defensive mechanisms to counteract them, particularly in the facial recognition domain.

> The commoditization of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) allows criminals to obtain financial benefits at a low risk and with little technical background. One such popular product in the underground economy is ransomware. In ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage (encrypted) until a fee is paid to the criminals. This modus operandi disrupts legitimate businesses, which may become unavailable until the data is restored. A recent blackmailing strategy adopted by criminals is to leak data online from the infected systems if the ransom is not paid. Besides reputational damage, data leakage might produce further economical losses due to fines imposed by data protection laws. Thus, research on prevention and recovery measures to mitigate the impact of such attacks is needed to adapt existing countermeasures to new strains.   In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of Avaddon, a ransomware offered in the underground economy as an affiliate program business. This has infected and leaked data from at least 23 organizations. Additionally, it runs Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against victims that do not pay the ransom. We first provide an analysis of the criminal business model from the underground economy. Then, we identify and describe its technical capabilities. We provide empirical evidence of links between this variant and a previous family, suggesting that the same group was behind the development and, possibly, the operation of both campaigns.   Finally, we describe a method to decrypt files encrypted with Avaddon in real time. We implement and test the decryptor in a tool that can recover the encrypted data from an infected system, thus mitigating the damage caused by the ransomware. The tool is released open-source so it can be incorporated in existing Antivirus engines.

> Cyber threat and attack intelligence information are available in non-standard format from heterogeneous sources. Comprehending them and utilizing them for threat intelligence extraction requires engaging security experts. Knowledge graphs enable converting this unstructured information from heterogeneous sources into a structured representation of data and factual knowledge for several downstream tasks such as predicting missing information and future threat trends. Existing large-scale knowledge graphs mainly focus on general classes of entities and relationships between them. Open-source knowledge graphs for the security domain do not exist. To fill this gap, we've built \textsf{TINKER} - a knowledge graph for threat intelligence (\textbf{T}hreat \textbf{IN}telligence \textbf{K}nowl\textbf{E}dge g\textbf{R}aph). \textsf{TINKER} is generated using RDF triples describing entities and relations from tokenized unstructured natural language text from 83 threat reports published between 2006-2021.

> In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial loss of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.

> Smartphones contain information that is more sensitive and personal than those found on computers and laptops. With an increase in the versatility of smartphone functionality, more data has become vulnerable and exposed to attackers. Successful mobile malware attacks could steal a user's location, photos, or even banking information. Due to a lack of post-attack strategies firms also risk going out of business due to data theft. Thus, there is a need besides just detecting malware intrusion in smartphones but to also identify the data that has been stolen to assess, aid in recovery and prevent future attacks. In this paper, we propose an accessible, non-intrusive machine learning solution to not only detect malware intrusion but also identify the type of data stolen for any app under supervision. We do this with Android usage data obtained by utilising publicly available data collection framework- SherLock. We test the performance of our architecture for multiple users on real-world data collected using the same framework. Our architecture exhibits less than 9% inaccuracy in detecting malware and can classify with 83% certainty on the type of data that is being stolen.

> Machine learning classification models are vulnerable to adversarial examples -- effective input-specific perturbations that can manipulate the model's output. Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which identify noisy patterns that generalize across the input space, allow the attacker to greatly scale up the generation of these adversarial examples. Although UAPs have been explored in application domains beyond computer vision, little is known about their properties and implications in the specific context of realizable attacks, such as malware, where attackers must reason about satisfying challenging problem-space constraints.   In this paper, we explore the challenges and strengths of UAPs in the context of malware classification. We generate sequences of problem-space transformations that induce UAPs in the corresponding feature-space embedding and evaluate their effectiveness across threat models that consider a varying degree of realistic attacker knowledge. Additionally, we propose adversarial training-based mitigations using knowledge derived from the problem-space transformations, and compare against alternative feature-space defenses. Our experiments limit the effectiveness of a white box Android evasion attack to ~20 % at the cost of 3 % TPR at 1 % FPR. We additionally show how our method can be adapted to more restrictive application domains such as Windows malware.   We observe that while adversarial training in the feature space must deal with large and often unconstrained regions, UAPs in the problem space identify specific vulnerabilities that allow us to harden a classifier more effectively, shifting the challenges and associated cost of identifying new universal adversarial transformations back to the attacker.

> As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, a number of malicious actors have started capitalizing the topic. Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains 4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique apps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique malicious apps) by the time of mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple perspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed apps as well as malicious ones began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic broke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged as benign apps using the same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their main purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit by using tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who have been active for a long time, while 75% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious developers are mainly located in US, mostly targeting countries including English-speaking countries, China, Arabic countries and Europe. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all the well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community. Till now, over 30 research institutes around the world have requested our dataset for COVID-19 themed research.

> Attackers are perpetually modifying their tactics to avoid detection and frequently leverage legitimate credentials with trusted tools already deployed in a network environment, making it difficult for organizations to proactively identify critical security risks. Network traffic analysis products have emerged in response to attackers relentless innovation, offering organizations a realistic path forward for combatting creative attackers. Additionally, thanks to the widespread adoption of cloud computing, Device Operators processes, and the Internet of Things, maintaining effective network visibility has become a highly complex and overwhelming process. What makes network traffic analysis technology particularly meaningful is its ability to combine its core capabilities to deliver malicious intent detection. In this paper, we propose a novel darknet traffic analysis and network management framework to real-time automating the malicious intent detection process, using a weight agnostic neural networks architecture. It is an effective and accurate computational intelligent forensics tool for network traffic analysis, the demystification of malware traffic, and encrypted traffic identification in real-time. Based on Weight Agnostic Neural Networks methodology, we propose an automated searching neural net architectures strategy that can perform various tasks such as identify zero-day attacks. By automating the malicious intent detection process from the darknet, the advanced proposed solution is reducing the skills and effort barrier that prevents many organizations from effectively protecting their most critical assets.

> Large amounts of threat intelligence information about mal-ware attacks are available in disparate, typically unstructured, formats. Knowledge graphs can capture this information and its context using RDF triples represented by entities and relations. Sparse or inaccurate threat information, however, leads to challenges such as incomplete or erroneous triples. Named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) models used to populate the knowledge graph cannot fully guaran-tee accurate information retrieval, further exacerbating this problem. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach to generate a Malware Knowledge Graph called MalKG, the first open-source automated knowledge graph for malware threat intelligence. MalKG dataset called MT40K1 contains approximately 40,000 triples generated from 27,354 unique entities and 34 relations. We demonstrate the application of MalKGin predicting missing malware threat intelligence information in the knowledge graph. For ground truth, we manually curate a knowledge graph called MT3K, with 3,027 triples generated from 5,741 unique entities and 22 relations. For entity prediction via a state-of-the-art entity prediction model(TuckER), our approach achieves 80.4 for the hits@10 metric (predicts the top 10 options for missing entities in the knowledge graph), and 0.75 for the MRR (mean reciprocal rank). We also propose a framework to automate the extraction of thousands of entities and relations into RDF triples, both manually and automatically, at the sentence level from1,100 malware threat intelligence reports and from the com-mon vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) database.

- `2003.13526v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13526v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13526v4)

> Windows malware detectors based on machine learning are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even if the attacker is only given black-box query access to the model. The main drawback of these attacks is that: (i) they are query-inefficient, as they rely on iteratively applying random transformations to the input malware; and (ii) they may also require executing the adversarial malware in a sandbox at each iteration of the optimization process, to ensure that its intrusive functionality is preserved. In this paper, we overcome these issues by presenting a novel family of black-box attacks that are both query-efficient and functionality-preserving, as they rely on the injection of benign content - which will never be executed - either at the end of the malicious file, or within some newly-created sections. Our attacks are formalized as a constrained minimization problem which also enables optimizing the trade-off between the probability of evading detection and the size of the injected payload. We empirically investigate this trade-off on two popular static Windows malware detectors, and show that our black-box attacks can bypass them with only few queries and small payloads, even when they only return the predicted labels. We also evaluate whether our attacks transfer to other commercial antivirus solutions, and surprisingly find that they can evade, on average, more than 12 commercial antivirus engines. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our approach, and its possible future extensions to target malware classifiers based on dynamic analysis.

> Ransomware has emerged as an infamous malware that has not escaped a lot of myths and inaccuracies from media hype. Victims are not sure whether or not to pay a ransom demand without fully understanding the lurking consequences. In this paper, we present a ransomware classification framework based on file-deletion and file-encryption attack structures that provides a deeper comprehension of potential flaws and inadequacies exhibited in ransomware. We formulate a threat and attack model representative of a typical ransomware attack process from which we derive the ransomware categorization framework based on a proposed classification algorithm. The framework classifies the virulence of a ransomware attack to entail the overall effectiveness of potential ways of recovering the attacked data without paying the ransom demand as well as the technical prowess of the underlying attack structures. Results of the categorization, in increasing severity from CAT1 through to CAT5, show that many ransomwares exhibit flaws in their implementation of encryption and deletion attack structures which make data recovery possible without paying the ransom. The most severe categories CAT4 and CAT5 are better mitigated by exploiting encryption essentials while CAT3 can be effectively mitigated via reverse engineering. CAT1 and CAT2 are not common and are easily mitigated without any decryption essentials.

> The use of operating system API calls is a promising task in the detection of PE-type malware in the Windows operating system. This task is officially defined as running malware in an isolated sandbox environment, recording the API calls made with the Windows operating system and sequentially analyzing these calls. Here, we have analyzed 7107 different malicious software belonging to various families such as virus, backdoor, trojan in an isolated sandbox environment and transformed these analysis results into a format where different classification algorithms and methods can be used. First, we'll explain how we got the malware, and then we'll explain how we've got these software bundled into families. Finally, we will describe how to perform malware classification tasks using different computational methods for the researchers who will use the data set we have created.

> The development of machine learning algorithms in the cyber security domain has been impeded by the complex, hierarchical, sequential and multimodal nature of the data involved. In this paper we introduce the notion of a streaming tree as a generic data structure encompassing a large portion of real-world cyber security data. Starting from host-based event logs we represent computer processes as streaming trees that evolve in continuous time. Leveraging the properties of the signature kernel, a machine learning tool that recently emerged as a leading technology for learning with complex sequences of data, we develop the SK-Tree algorithm. SK-Tree is a supervised learning method for systematic malware detection on streaming trees that is robust to irregular sampling and high dimensionality of the underlying streams. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SK-Tree to detect malicious events on a portion of the publicly available DARPA OpTC dataset, achieving an AUROC score of 98%.

> Although using machine learning techniques to solve computer security challenges is not a new idea, the rapidly emerging Deep Learning technology has recently triggered a substantial amount of interests in the computer security community. This paper seeks to provide a dedicated review of the very recent research works on using Deep Learning techniques to solve computer security challenges. In particular, the review covers eight computer security problems being solved by applications of Deep Learning: security-oriented program analysis, defending return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks, achieving control-flow integrity (CFI), defending network attacks, malware classification, system-event-based anomaly detection, memory forensics, and fuzzing for software security.

> Robustness of machine learning models is critical for security related applications, where real-world adversaries are uniquely focused on evading neural network based detectors. Prior work mainly focus on crafting adversarial examples with small uniform norm-bounded perturbations across features to maintain the requirement of imperceptibility. Although such approaches are valid for images, uniform perturbations do not result in realistic adversarial examples in domains such as malware, finance, and social networks. For these types of applications, features typically have some semantically meaningful dependencies. The key idea of our proposed approach is to enable non-uniform perturbations that can adequately represent these feature dependencies during adversarial training. We propose using characteristics of the empirical data distribution, both on correlations between the features and the importance of the features themselves. Using experimental datasets for malware classification, credit risk prediction, and spam detection, we show that our approach is more robust to real-world attacks. Our approach can be adapted to other domains where non-uniform perturbations more accurately represent realistic adversarial examples.

> In recent years the PC has been replaced by mobile devices for many security sensitive operations, both from a privacy and a financial standpoint. While security mechanisms are deployed at various levels, these are frequently put under strain by previously unseen malware. An additional protection layer capable of novelty detection is therefore needed. In this work we propose SpotCheck, an anomaly detector intended to run on Android devices. It samples app executions and submits suspicious apps to more thorough processing by malware sandboxes. We compare Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) on app execution representations based on the well-known system call traces, as well as a novel approach based on memory dumps. Results show that when using VAE, SpotCheck attains a level of effectiveness comparable to what has been previously achieved for network anomaly detection. Interestingly this is also true for the memory dump approach, relinquishing the need for continuous app monitoring.

> New data processing pipelines and novel network architectures increasingly drive the success of deep learning. In consequence, the industry considers top-performing architectures as intellectual property and devotes considerable computational resources to discovering such architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). This provides an incentive for adversaries to steal these novel architectures; when used in the cloud, to provide Machine Learning as a Service, the adversaries also have an opportunity to reconstruct the architectures by exploiting a range of hardware side channels. However, it is challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing the computational graph (e.g., the layers, branches or skip connections), the architectural parameters (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer) or the specific pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we design an algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep learning system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process. We implement our algorithm in PyTorch and Tensorflow. We demonstrate experimentally that we can reconstruct MalConv, a novel data pre-processing pipeline for malware detection, and ProxylessNAS- CPU, a novel network architecture for the ImageNet classification optimized to run on CPUs, without knowing the architecture family. In both cases, we achieve 0% error. These results suggest hardware side channels are a practical attack vector against MLaaS, and more efforts should be devoted to understanding their impact on the security of deep learning systems.

> The Internet of Things (IoT) has been revolutionizing this world by introducing exciting applications almost in all walks of daily life, such as healthcare, smart cities, smart environments, safety, remote sensing, and many more. This paper proposes a new framework based on the blockchain and deep learning model to provide more security for Android IoT devices. Moreover, our framework is capable to find the malware activities in a real-time environment. The proposed deep learning model analyzes various static and dynamic features extracted from thousands of feature of malware and benign apps that are already stored in blockchain distributed ledger. The multi-layer deep learning model makes decisions by analyzing the previous data and follow some steps. Firstly, it divides the malware feature into multiple level clusters. Secondly, it chooses a unique deep learning model for each malware feature set or cluster. Finally, it produces the decision by combining the results generated from all cluster levels. Furthermore, the decisions and multiple-level clustering data are stored in a blockchain that can be further used to train every specialized cluster for unique data distribution. Also, a customized smart contract is designed to detect deceptive applications through the blockchain framework. The smart contract verifies the malicious application both during the uploading and downloading process of Android apps on the network. Consequently, the proposed framework provides flexibility to features for run-time security regarding malware detection on heterogeneous IoT devices. Finally, the smart contract helps to approve or deny to uploading and downloading harmful Android applications.

> The short note presents an image classification dataset consisting of 10 executable code varieties and approximately 50,000 virus examples. The malicious classes include 9 families of computer viruses and one benign set. The image formatting for the first 1024 bytes of the Portable Executable (PE) mirrors the familiar MNIST handwriting dataset, such that most of the previously explored algorithmic methods can transfer with minor modifications. The designation of 9 virus families for malware derives from unsupervised learning of class labels; we discover the families with KMeans clustering that excludes the non-malicious examples. As a benchmark using deep learning methods (MobileNetV2), we find an overall 80% accuracy for virus identification by families when beneware is included. We also find that once a positive malware detection occurs (by signature or heuristics), the projection of the first 1024 bytes into a thumbnail image can classify with 87% accuracy the type of virus. The work generalizes what other malware investigators have demonstrated as promising convolutional neural networks originally developed to solve image problems but applied to a new abstract domain in pixel bytes from executable files. The dataset is available on Kaggle and Github.

> Today anti-malware community is facing challenges due to the ever-increasing sophistication and volume of malware attacks developed by adversaries. Traditional malware detection mechanisms are not able to cope-up with next-generation malware attacks. Therefore in this paper, we propose effective and efficient Android malware detection models based on machine learning and deep learning integrated with clustering. We performed a comprehensive study of different feature reduction, classification and clustering algorithms over various performance metrics to construct the Android malware detection models. Our experimental results show that malware detection models developed using Random Forest eclipsed deep neural network and other classifiers on the majority of performance metrics. The baseline Random Forest model without any feature reduction achieved the highest AUC of 99.4%. Also, the segregating of vector space using clustering integrated with Random Forest further boosted the AUC to 99.6% in one cluster and direct detection of Android malware in another cluster, thus reducing the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, we found that feature reduction in detection models does improve the model efficiency (training and testing time) many folds without much penalty on the effectiveness of the detection model.

> Since Google unveiled Android OS for smartphones, malware are thriving with 3Vs, i.e. volume, velocity, and variety. A recent report indicates that one out of every five business/industry mobile application leaks sensitive personal data. Traditional signature/heuristic-based malware detection systems are unable to cope up with current malware challenges and thus threaten the Android ecosystem. Therefore recently researchers have started exploring machine learning and deep learning based malware detection systems. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive feature analysis to identify the significant Android permissions and propose an efficient Android malware detection system using machine learning and deep neural network. We constructed a set of $16$ permissions ($8\%$ of the total set) derived from variance threshold, auto-encoders, and principal component analysis to build a malware detection engine that consumes less train and test time without significant compromise on the model accuracy. Our experimental results show that the Android malware detection model based on the random forest classifier is most balanced and achieves the highest area under curve score of $97.7\%$, which is better than the current state-of-art systems. We also observed that deep neural networks attain comparable accuracy to the baseline results but with a massive computational penalty.

> In this paper, we set out to systematically design a minimal active RoT for tiny low-end MCU-s. We begin with the following questions: (1) What functions and hardware support are required to guarantee actions in the presence of malware?, (2) How to implement this efficiently?, and (3) What security benefits stem from such an active RoT architecture? We then design, implement, formally verify, and evaluate GAROTA: Generalized Active Root-Of-Trust Architecture. We believe that GAROTA is the first clean-slate design of an active RoT for low-end MCU-s. We show how GAROTA guarantees that even a fully software-compromised low-end MCU performs a desired action. We demonstrate its practicality by implementing GAROTA in the context of three types of applications where actions are triggered by: sensing hardware, network events and timers. We also formally specify and verify GAROTA functionality and properties.

> Malware classification is an important and challenging problem in information security. Modern malware classification techniques rely on machine learning models that can be trained on features such as opcode sequences, API calls, and byte $n$-grams, among many others. In this research, we consider opcode features. We implement hybrid machine learning techniques, where we engineer feature vectors by training hidden Markov models -- a technique that we refer to as HMM2Vec -- and Word2Vec embeddings on these opcode sequences. The resulting HMM2Vec and Word2Vec embedding vectors are then used as features for classification algorithms. Specifically, we consider support vector machine (SVM), $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. We conduct substantial experiments over a variety of malware families. Our experiments extend well beyond any previous work in this field.

> Signature and anomaly based techniques are the quintessential approaches to malware detection. However, these techniques have become increasingly ineffective as malware has become more sophisticated and complex. Researchers have therefore turned to deep learning to construct better performing model. In this paper, we create four different long-short term memory (LSTM) based models and train each to classify malware samples from 20 families. Our features consist of opcodes extracted from malware executables. We employ techniques used in natural language processing (NLP), including word embedding and bidirection LSTMs (biLSTM), and we also use convolutional neural networks (CNN). We find that a model consisting of word embedding, biLSTMs, and CNN layers performs best in our malware classification experiments.

> Discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) are often applied to malware detection and classification problems. However, the continuous analog of discrete HMMs, that is, Gaussian mixture model-HMMs (GMM-HMM), are rarely considered in the field of cybersecurity. In this paper, we use GMM-HMMs for malware classification and we compare our results to those obtained using discrete HMMs. As features, we consider opcode sequences and entropy-based sequences. For our opcode features, GMM-HMMs produce results that are comparable to those obtained using discrete HMMs, whereas for our entropy-based features, GMM-HMMs generally improve significantly on the classification results that we have achieved with discrete HMMs.

Transformers, a category of attention-based deep learning techniques, have recently shown impressive results in solving different tasks mainly related to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, we propose the use of a Transformers' architecture to automatically detect malicious software. We propose a model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which performs a static analysis on the source code of Android applications using preprocessed features to characterize existing malware and classify it into different representative malware categories. The obtained results are promising and show the high performance obtained by Transformer-based models for malicious software detection.

> Emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency-based technologies are redefining the way we conduct business in cyberspace. Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through \textit{cryptojacking} malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging cryptojacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features.

> Word embeddings are often used in natural language processing as a means to quantify relationships between words. More generally, these same word embedding techniques can be used to quantify relationships between features. In this paper, we first consider multiple different word embedding techniques within the context of malware classification. We use hidden Markov models to obtain embedding vectors in an approach that we refer to as HMM2Vec, and we generate vector embeddings based on principal component analysis. We also consider the popular neural network based word embedding technique known as Word2Vec. In each case, we derive feature embeddings based on opcode sequences for malware samples from a variety of different families. We show that we can obtain better classification accuracy based on these feature embeddings, as compared to HMM experiments that directly use the opcode sequences, and serve to establish a baseline. These results show that word embeddings can be a useful feature engineering step in the field of malware analysis.

> In this paper, we consider ensemble classifiers, that is, machine learning based classifiers that utilize a combination of scoring functions.

From this general introduction, we then pivot to the topic of ensemble learning within the context of malware analysis. We present a brief survey of some of the ensemble techniques that have been used in malware (and related) research. We conclude with an extensive set of experiments, where we apply ensemble techniques to a large and challenging malware dataset. While many of these ensemble techniques have appeared in the malware literature, previously there has been no way to directly compare results such as these, as different datasets and different measures of success are typically used. Our common framework and empirical results are an effort to bring some sense of order to the chaos that is evident in the evolving field of ensemble learning -- both within the narrow confines of the malware analysis problem, and in the larger realm of machine learning in general.

> Malware detection is a critical aspect of information security. One difficulty that arises is that malware often evolves over time. To maintain effective malware detection, it is necessary to determine when malware evolution has occurred so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. We perform a variety of experiments aimed at detecting points in time where a malware family has likely evolved, and we consider secondary tests designed to confirm that evolution has actually occurred. Several malware families are analyzed, each of which includes a number of samples collected over an extended period of time. Our experiments indicate that improved results are obtained using feature engineering based on word embedding techniques. All of our experiments are based on machine learning models, and hence our evolution detection strategies require minimal human intervention and can easily be automated.

> Malicious applications (especially in the Android platform) are a serious threat to developers and end-users. Many research efforts have hence been devoted to developing effective approaches to defend Android malware. However, with the explosive growth of Android malware and the continuous advancement of malicious evasion technologies like obfuscation and reflection, android malware defenses based on manual rules or traditional machine learning may not be effective due to limited apriori knowledge. In recent years, a dominant research field of deep learning (DL) with the powerful feature abstraction ability has demonstrated a compelling and promising performance in various fields, like Nature Language processing and image processing. To this end, employing deep learning techniques to thwart the attack of Android malware has recently gained considerable research attention. Yet, there exists no systematic literature review that focuses on deep learning approaches for Android Malware defenses. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to search and analyze how deep learning approaches have been applied in the context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of 104 studies were identified over the period 2014-2020. The results of our investigation show that even though most of these studies still mainly consider DL-based on Android malware detection, 35 primary studies (33.7\%) design the defenses approaches based on other scenarios. This review also describes research trends, research focuses, challenges, and future research directions in DL-based Android malware defenses.

> Security is critical to the adoption of open source software (OSS), yet few automated solutions currently exist to help detect and prevent malicious contributions from infecting open source repositories. On GitHub, a primary host of OSS, repositories contain not only code but also a wealth of commit-related and contextual metadata - what if this metadata could be used to automatically identify malicious OSS contributions? In this work, we show how to use only commit logs and repository metadata to automatically detect anomalous and potentially malicious commits. We identify and evaluate several relevant factors which can be automatically computed from this data, such as the modification of sensitive files, outlier change properties, or a lack of trust in the commit's author. Our tool, Anomalicious, automatically computes these factors and considers them holistically using a rule-based decision model. In an evaluation on a data set of 15 malware-infected repositories, Anomalicious showed promising results and identified 53.33% of malicious commits, while flagging less than 1% of commits for most repositories. Additionally, the tool found other interesting anomalies that are not related to malicious commits in an analysis of repositories with no known malicious commits.

> Android's security model severely limits the capabilities of anti-malware software. Unlike commodity anti-malware solutions on desktop systems, their Android counterparts run as sandboxed applications without root privileges and are limited by Android's permission system. As such, PHAs on Android are usually willingly installed by victims, as they come disguised as useful applications with hidden malicious functionality, and are encountered on mobile app stores as suggestions based on the apps that a user previously installed. Users with similar interests and app installation history are likely to be exposed and to decide to install the same PHA. This observation gives us the opportunity to develop predictive approaches that can warn the user about which PHAs they will encounter and potentially be tempted to install in the near future. These approaches could then be used to complement commodity anti-malware solutions, which are focused on post-fact detection, closing the window of opportunity that existing solutions suffer from. In this paper we develop Andruspex, a system based on graph representation learning, allowing us to learn latent relationships between user devices and PHAs and leverage them for prediction. We test Andruspex on a real world dataset of PHA installations collected by a security company, and show that our approach achieves very high prediction results (up to 0.994 TPR at 0.0001 FPR), while at the same time outperforming alternative baseline methods. We also demonstrate that Andruspex is robust and its runtime performance is acceptable for a real world deployment.

> Machine learning-based hardware malware detectors (HMDs) offer a potential game changing advantage in defending systems against malware. However, HMDs suffer from adversarial attacks, can be effectively reverse-engineered and subsequently be evaded, allowing malware to hide from detection. We address this issue by proposing a novel HMDs (Stochastic-HMDs) through approximate computing, which makes HMDs' inference computation-stochastic, thereby making HMDs resilient against adversarial evasion attacks. Specifically, we propose to leverage voltage overscaling to induce stochastic computation in the HMDs model. We show that such a technique makes HMDs more resilient to both black-box adversarial attack scenarios, i.e., reverse-engineering and transferability. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stochastic-HMDs offer effective defense against adversarial attacks along with by-product power savings, without requiring any changes to the hardware/software nor to the HMDs' model, i.e., no retraining or fine tuning is needed. Moreover, based on recent results in probably approximately correct (PAC) learnability theory, we show that Stochastic-HMDs are provably more difficult to reverse engineer.

> Malware analysis is still largely a manual task. This slow and inefficient approach does not scale to the exponential rise in the rate of new unique malware generated. Hence, automating the process as much as possible becomes desirable.   In this paper, we present ColdPress - an extensible malware analysis platform that automates the end-to-end process of malware threat intelligence gathering integrated output modules to perform report generation of arbitrary file formats. ColdPress combines state-of-the-art tools and concepts into a modular system that aids the analyst to efficiently and effectively extract information from malware samples. It is designed as a user-friendly and extensible platform that can be easily extended with user-defined modules.   We evaluated ColdPress with complex real-world malware samples (e.g., WannaCry), demonstrating its efficiency, performance and usefulness to security analysts.

> In recent years machine learning algorithms, and more specifically deep learning algorithms, have been widely used in many fields, including cyber security. However, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and this limits the application of machine learning, especially in non-stationary, adversarial environments, such as the cyber security domain, where actual adversaries (e.g., malware developers) exist. This paper comprehensively summarizes the latest research on adversarial attacks against security solutions based on machine learning techniques and illuminates the risks they pose. First, the adversarial attack methods are characterized based on their stage of occurrence, and the attacker's goals and capabilities. Then, we categorize the applications of adversarial attack and defense methods in the cyber security domain. Finally, we highlight some characteristics identified in recent research and discuss the impact of recent advancements in other adversarial learning domains on future research directions in the cyber security domain. This paper is the first to discuss the unique challenges of implementing end-to-end adversarial attacks in the cyber security domain, map them in a unified taxonomy, and use the taxonomy to highlight future research directions.

> There is a lack of scientific testing of commercially available malware detectors, especially those that boast accurate classification of never-before-seen (i.e., zero-day) files using machine learning (ML). The result is that the efficacy and gaps among the available approaches are opaque, inhibiting end users from making informed network security decisions and researchers from targeting gaps in current detectors. In this paper, we present a scientific evaluation of four market-leading malware detection tools to assist an organization with two primary questions: (Q1) To what extent do ML-based tools accurately classify never-before-seen files without sacrificing detection ability on known files? (Q2) Is it worth purchasing a network-level malware detector to complement host-based detection? We tested each tool against 3,536 total files (2,554 or 72% malicious, 982 or 28% benign) including over 400 zero-day malware, and tested with a variety of file types and protocols for delivery. We present statistical results on detection time and accuracy, consider complementary analysis (using multiple tools together), and provide two novel applications of a recent cost-benefit evaluation procedure by Iannaconne & Bridges that incorporates all the above metrics into a single quantifiable cost. While the ML-based tools are more effective at detecting zero-day files and executables, the signature-based tool may still be an overall better option. Both network-based tools provide substantial (simulated) savings when paired with either host tool, yet both show poor detection rates on protocols other than HTTP or SMTP. Our results show that all four tools have near-perfect precision but alarmingly low recall, especially on file types other than executables and office files -- 37% of malware tested, including all polyglot files, were undetected.

> Machine learning (ML) models that learn and predict properties of computer programs are increasingly being adopted and deployed. These models have demonstrated success in applications such as auto-completing code, summarizing large programs, and detecting bugs and malware in programs. In this work, we investigate principled ways to adversarially perturb a computer program to fool such learned models, and thus determine their adversarial robustness. We use program obfuscations, which have conventionally been used to avoid attempts at reverse engineering programs, as adversarial perturbations. These perturbations modify programs in ways that do not alter their functionality but can be crafted to deceive an ML model when making a decision. We provide a general formulation for an adversarial program that allows applying multiple obfuscation transformations to a program in any language. We develop first-order optimization algorithms to efficiently determine two key aspects -- which parts of the program to transform, and what transformations to use. We show that it is important to optimize both these aspects to generate the best adversarially perturbed program. Due to the discrete nature of this problem, we also propose using randomized smoothing to improve the attack loss landscape to ease optimization. We evaluate our work on Python and Java programs on the problem of program summarization. We show that our best attack proposal achieves a $52\%$ improvement over a state-of-the-art attack generation approach for programs trained on a seq2seq model. We further show that our formulation is better at training models that are robust to adversarial attacks.

> Nowadays ransomware has become a new profitable form of attack. This type of malware acts as a form of extortion which encrypts the files in a victim's computer and forces the victim to pay the ransom to have the data recovered. Even companies and tech savvy people must use extensive resources to maintain backups for recovery or else they will lose valuable data, not mentioning average users. Unfortunately, not any recovery tool can effectively defend various types of ransomware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ransomware defense mechanism that can be easily deployed in modern Windows system to recover the data and mitigate a ransomware attack. The uniqueness of our approach is to fight the virus like a virus. We leverage Alternative Data Streams which are sometimes used by malicious applications, to develop a data protection method that misleads the ransomware to attack only file 'shells' instead of the actual file content. We evaluated different file encrypting ransomware and demonstrate usability, efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

> Hardware-based Malware Detectors (HMDs) using Machine Learning (ML) models have shown promise in detecting malicious workloads. However, the conventional black-box based machine learning (ML) approach used in these HMDs fail to address the uncertain predictions, including those made on zero-day malware. The ML models used in HMDs are agnostic to the uncertainty that determines whether the model "knows what it knows," severely undermining its trustworthiness. We propose an ensemble-based approach that quantifies uncertainty in predictions made by ML models of an HMD, when it encounters an unknown workload than the ones it was trained on. We test our approach on two different HMDs that have been proposed in the literature. We show that the proposed uncertainty estimator can detect >90% of unknown workloads for the Power-management based HMD, and conclude that the overlapping benign and malware classes undermine the trustworthiness of the Performance Counter-based HMD.

> Recent work has shown that adversarial Windows malware samples - referred to as adversarial EXEmples in this paper - can bypass machine learning-based detection relying on static code analysis by perturbing relatively few input bytes. To preserve malicious functionality, previous attacks either add bytes to existing non-functional areas of the file, potentially limiting their effectiveness, or require running computationally-demanding validation steps to discard malware variants that do not correctly execute in sandbox environments. In this work, we overcome these limitations by developing a unifying framework that does not only encompass and generalize previous attacks against machine-learning models, but also includes three novel attacks based on practical, functionality-preserving manipulations to the Windows Portable Executable (PE) file format. These attacks, named Full DOS, Extend and Shift, inject the adversarial payload by respectively manipulating the DOS header, extending it, and shifting the content of the first section. Our experimental results show that these attacks outperform existing ones in both white-box and black-box scenarios, achieving a better trade-off in terms of evasion rate and size of the injected payload, while also enabling evasion of models that have been shown to be robust to previous attacks. To facilitate reproducibility of our findings, we open source our framework and all the corresponding attack implementations as part of the secml-malware Python library. We conclude this work by discussing the limitations of current machine learning-based malware detectors, along with potential mitigation strategies based on embedding domain knowledge coming from subject-matter experts directly into the learning process.

> Classifying mobile apps based on their description is beneficial for several purposes. However, many app descriptions do not reflect app functionalities, whether accidentally or on purpose. Most importantly, these app classification methods do not work if the app description is unavailable. This paper investigates a Reverse Engineering-based Approach to Classify mobile apps using The data that exists in the app, called REACT. To validate the proposed REACT method, we use a large set of Android apps (24,652 apps in total). We also show REACTs' extendibility for malware/anomaly detection and prove its reliability and scalability. However, our analysis shows some limitations in REACT procedure and implementation, especially for similar feature based app grouping. We discuss the root cause of these failures, our key lessons learned, and some future enhancement ideas. We also share our REACT tools and reproduced datasets for the app market analyst, mobile app developers and software engineering research communities for further research purposes.

> Research in the field of malware classification often relies on machine learning models that are trained on high-level features, such as opcodes, function calls, and control flow graphs. Extracting such features is costly, since disassembly or code execution is generally required. In this paper, we conduct experiments to train and evaluate machine learning models for malware classification, based on features that can be obtained without disassembly or execution of code. Specifically, we visualize malware samples as images and employ image analysis techniques. In this context, we focus on two machine learning models, namely, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). Surprisingly, we find that ELMs can achieve accuracies on par with CNNs, yet ELM training requires less than~2\%\ of the time needed to train a comparable CNN.

Amongst our CNN experiments, transfer learning plays a prominent role specifically, we test the VGG-19 and ResNet152 models. As compared to previous work, the results presented in this paper are based on a larger and more diverse malware dataset, we consider a wider array of features, and we experiment with a much greater variety of learning techniques.

> Since compiler optimization is the most common source contributing to binary code differences in syntax, testing the resilience against the changes caused by different compiler optimization settings has become a standard evaluation step for most binary diffing approaches. For example, 47 top-venue papers in the last 12 years compared different program versions compiled by default optimization levels (e.g., -Ox in GCC and LLVM). Although many of them claim they are immune to compiler transformations, it is yet unclear about their resistance to non-default optimization settings. Especially, we have observed that adversaries explored non-default compiler settings to amplify malware differences.   This paper takes the first step to systematically studying the effectiveness of compiler optimization on binary code differences. We tailor search-based iterative compilation for the auto-tuning of binary code differences. We develop BinTuner to search near-optimal optimization sequences that can maximize the amount of binary code differences. We run BinTuner with GCC 10.2 and LLVM 11.0 on SPEC benchmarks (CPU2006 & CPU2017), Coreutils, and OpenSSL. Our experiments show that at the cost of 279 to 1,881 compilation iterations, BinTuner can find custom optimization sequences that are substantially better than the general -Ox settings. BinTuner's outputs seriously undermine prominent binary diffing tools' comparisons. In addition, the detection rate of the IoT malware variants tuned by BinTuner falls by more than 50%. Our findings paint a cautionary tale for security analysts that attackers have a new way to mutate malware code cost-effectively, and the research community needs to step back to reassess optimization-resistance evaluations.

> The lack of security measures among the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their persistent online connection gives adversaries a prime opportunity to target them or even abuse them as intermediary targets in larger attacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns. In this paper, we analyze IoT malware and focus on the endpoints reachable on the public Internet, that play an essential part in the IoT malware ecosystem. Namely, we analyze endpoints acting as dropzones and their targets to gain insights into the underlying dynamics in this ecosystem, such as the affinity between the dropzones and their target IP addresses, and the different patterns among endpoints. Towards this goal, we reverse-engineer 2,423 IoT malware samples and extract strings from them to obtain IP addresses. We further gather information about these endpoints from public Internet-wide scanners, such as Shodan and Censys. For the masked IP addresses, we examine the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) networks accumulating to more than 100 million (78.2% of total active public IPv4 addresses) endpoints. Our investigation from four different perspectives provides profound insights into the role of endpoints in IoT malware attacks, which deepens our understanding of IoT malware ecosystems and can assist future defenses.

> The Linux shell is a command-line interpreter that provides users with a command interface to the operating system, allowing them to perform a variety of functions. Although very useful in building capabilities at the edge, the Linux shell can be exploited, giving adversaries a prime opportunity to use them for malicious activities. With access to IoT devices, malware authors can abuse the Linux shell of those devices to propagate infections and launch large-scale attacks, e.g., DDoS. In this work, we provide a first look at shell commands used in Linux-based IoT malware towards detection. We analyze malicious shell commands found in IoT malware and build a neural network-based model, ShellCore, to detect malicious shell commands. Namely, we collected a large dataset of shell commands, including malicious commands extracted from 2,891 IoT malware samples and benign commands collected from real-world network traffic analysis and volunteered data from Linux users. Using conventional machine and deep learning-based approaches trained with term- and character-level features, ShellCore is shown to achieve an accuracy of more than 99% in detecting malicious shell commands and files (i.e., binaries).

> We offer an embedding of CPython that runs entirely in memory without "touching" the disk. This in-memory embedding can load Python scripts directly from memory instead these scripts having to be loaded from files on disk. Malware that resides only in memory is harder to detect or mitigate against. We intend for our work to be used by security researchers to rapidly develop and deploy offensive techniques that is difficult for security products to analyze given these instructions are in bytecode and only translated to machine-code by the interpreter immediately prior to execution. Our work helps security researchers and enterprise Red Teams who play offense. Red Teams want to rapidly prototype malware for their periodic campaigns and do not want their malware to be detected by the Incident Response (IR) teams prior to accomplishing objectives. Red Teams also have difficulty running malware in production from files on disk as modern enterprise security products emulate, inspect, or quarantine such executables given these files have no reputation. Our work also helps enterprise Hunt and IR teams by making them aware of the viability of this type of attack. Our approach has been in use in production for over a year and meets our customers' needs to quickly emulate threat-actors' tasks, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

> In recent years malware has become increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect prior to exploitation. While there are plenty of approaches to malware detection, they all have shortcomings when it comes to identifying malware correctly prior to exploitation. The trade-off is usually between false positives, causing overhead, preventing normal usage and the risk of letting the malware execute and cause damage to the target. We present a novel end-to-end solution for in-memory malicious activity detection done prior to exploitation by leveraging machine learning capabilities based on data from unique run-time logs, which are carefully curated in order to detect malicious activity in the memory of protected processes. This solution achieves reduced overhead and false positives as well as deployment simplicity. We implemented our solution for Windows-based systems, employing multi disciplinary knowledge from malware research, machine learning, and operating system internals. Our experimental evaluation yielded promising results. As we expect future sophisticated malware may try to bypass it, we also discuss how our solution can be extended to thwart such bypassing attempts.

> Many malware campaigns use Microsoft (MS) Office documents as droppers to download and execute their malicious payload. Such campaigns often use these documents because MS Office is installed in billions of devices and that these files allow the execution of arbitrary VBA code. Recent versions of MS Office prevent the automatic execution of VBA macros, so malware authors try to convince users into enabling the content via images that, e.g. forge system or technical errors. In this work, we leverage these visual elements to construct lightweight malware signatures that can be applied with minimal effort. We test and validate our approach using an extensive database of malware samples and identify correlations between different campaigns that illustrate that some campaigns are either using the same tools or that there is some collaboration between them.

> The malware and botnet phenomenon is among the most significant threats to cybersecurity today. Consequently, law enforcement agencies, security companies, and researchers are constantly seeking to disrupt these malicious operations through so-called takedown counter-operations. Unfortunately, the success of these takedowns is mixed. Furthermore, very little is understood as to how botnets and malware delivery operations respond to takedown attempts. We present a comprehensive study of three malware delivery operations that were targeted for takedown in 2015-16 using global download metadata provided by a major security company. In summary, we found that: (1) Distributed delivery architectures were commonly used, indicating the need for better security hygiene and coordination by the (ab)used service providers. (2) A minority of malware binaries were responsible for the majority of download activity, suggesting that detecting these "super binaries" would yield the most benefit to the security community. (3) The malware operations exhibited displacing and defiant behaviours following their respective takedown attempts. We argue that these "predictable" behaviours could be factored into future takedown strategies. (4) The malware operations also exhibited previously undocumented behaviours, such as Dridex dropping competing brands of malware, or Dorkbot and Upatre heavily relying on upstream dropper malware. These "unpredictable" behaviours indicate the need for researchers to use better threat-monitoring techniques.

> Malicious software (malware) poses an increasing threat to the security of communication systems, as the number of interconnected mobile devices increases exponentially. While some existing malware detection and classification approaches successfully leverage network traffic data, they treat network flows between pairs of endpoints independently and thus fail to leverage the rich structural dependencies in the complete network. Our approach first extracts flow graphs and subsequently classifies them using a novel graph neural network model. We present three variants of our base model, which all support malware detection and classification in supervised and unsupervised settings. We evaluate our approach on flow graphs that we extract from a recently published dataset for mobile malware detection that addresses several issues with previously available datasets. Experiments on four different prediction tasks consistently demonstrate the advantages of our approach and show that our graph neural network model can boost detection performance by a significant margin.

> Malware has become a widely used means in cyber attacks in recent decades because of various new obfuscation techniques used by malwares. In order to protect the systems, data and information, detection of malware is needed as early as possible. There are various studies on malware detection techniques that have been done but there is no method which can detect the malware completely and make malware detection problematic. Static Malware analysis is very effective for known malwares but it does not work for zero day malware which leads to the need of dynamic malware detection and the behaviour based malware detection is comparatively good among all detection techniques like signature based, deep learning based, mobile/IOT and cloud based detection but still it is not able to detect all zero day malware which shows the malware detection is very challenging task and need more techniques for malware detection. This paper describes a literature review of various methods of malware detection. A short description of each method is provided and discusses various studies already done in the advanced malware detection field and their comparison based on the detection method used, accuracy and other parameters. Apart from this we will discuss various malware detection tools, dataset and their sources which can be used in further study. This paper gives you the detailed knowledge of advanced malwares, its detection methods, how you can protect your devices and data from malware attacks and it gives the comparison of different studies on malware detection.

> The Android operating system is the most spread mobile platform in the world. Therefor attackers are producing an incredible number of malware applications for Android. Our aim is to detect Android's malware in order to protect the user. To do so really good results are obtained by dynamic analysis of software, but it requires complex environments. In order to achieve the same level of precision we analyze the machine code and investigate the frequencies of ngrams of opcodes in order to detect singular code blocks. This allow us to construct a database of infected code blocks. Then, because attacker may modify and organized differently the infected injected code in their new malware, we perform not only a semantic comparison of the tested software with the database of infected code blocks but also a structured comparison. To do such comparison we compute subgraph isomorphism. It allows us to characterize precisely if the tested software is a malware and if so in witch family it belongs. Our method is tested both on a laboratory database and a set of real data. It achieves an almost perfect detection rate.

> Android is one of the leading operating systems for smart phones in terms of market share and usage. Unfortunately, it is also an appealing target for attackers to compromise its security through malicious applications. To tackle this issue, domain experts and researchers are trying different techniques to stop such attacks. All the attempts of securing Android platform are somewhat successful. However, existing detection techniques have severe shortcomings, including the cumbersome process of feature engineering. Designing representative features require expert domain knowledge. There is a need for minimizing human experts' intervention by circumventing handcrafted feature engineering. Deep learning could be exploited by extracting deep features automatically. Previous work has shown that operational codes (opcodes) of executables provide key information to be used with deep learning models for detection process of malicious applications. The only challenge is to feed opcodes information to deep learning models. Existing techniques use one-hot encoding to tackle the challenge. However, the one-hot encoding scheme has severe limitations. In this paper, we introduce; (1) a novel technique for opcodes embedding, which we name Op2Vec, (2) based on the learned Op2Vec we have developed a dataset for end-to-end detection of android malware. Introducing the end-to-end Android malware detection technique avoids expert-intensive handcrafted features extraction, and ensures automation. The comparison shows that Op2Vec outperforms the existing one-hot encoding technique for opcode embedding and the developed dataset can provide significant insights for end-to-end detection of Android malware.

> Our computer systems for decades have been threatened by various types of hardware and software attacks of which Malwares have been one of them. This malware has the ability to steal, destroy, contaminate, gain unintended access, or even disrupt the entire system. There have been techniques to detect malware by performing static and dynamic analysis of malware files, but, stealthy malware has circumvented the static analysis method and for dynamic analysis, there have been previous works that propose different methods to detect malware but, in this work we propose a novel technique to detect malware. We use malware binary images and then extract different features from the same and then employ different ML-classifiers on the dataset thus obtained. We show that this technique is successful in differentiating classes of malware based on the features extracted.

- `2005.03873v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03873v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03873v2)

> We propose Remote Attestation with TOCTOU Avoidance (RATA): a provably secure approach to address the RA TOCTOU problem. With RATA, even malware that erases itself before execution of the next RA, can not hide its ephemeral presence. RATA targets hybrid RA architectures (implemented as Hardware/Software co-designs), which are aimed at low-end embedded devices. We present two alternative techniques - RATAa and RATAb - suitable for devices with and without real-time clocks, respectively. Each is shown to be secure and accompanied by a publicly available and formally verified implementation. Our evaluation demonstrates low hardware overhead of both techniques. Compared with current RA architectures - that offer no TOCTOU protection - RATA incurs no extra runtime overhead. In fact, RATA substantially reduces computational costs of RA execution.
